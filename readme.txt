## What You'll Do

Difficulty: 2

Expanding on your previous book application you now want to create a class for 
technical books. Using the Book class constructed in the last example, extend the 
functionality to the new TechnicalBook class.

The new TechnicalBook class will take a book edition as a fifth argument.

You should add a getEdition method which prints 
`The current version of this book is ${version}`.
